The console serves as my Final Term Project for OOP course.The console supports three roles- Patient, Doctor and Admin, namely and manages bills, appointments, prescriptions, records, and security etc. All data that is required for basic information and initial record is shared across the program via a .txt file.

ADDITIONAL NOTES
Std::string or any built in string functions are not used or implemented anywhere in the code logic due to the constraints added in the assignment. They are only employed in the SFML/GUI code.
Std::vector is also only implemented in the GUI implementation as permitted.
There are no memory leakages in the program.
